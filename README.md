# ftx profiler

a TUI volume profile and 'time and sales' application.

as of now (feb 12, 2022), little account functionality has been added, but plans are to add full trading functionality in a similar fashion to my other project 'tori'.

command line arguments currently are:
	* tape-only
		display only tape window
	* profile-only
		display only voume profile
	* volume-counts
		print a tally of volume conducted at each price level on the profile
