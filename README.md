# ftx profiler

A TUI volume profile and 'time and sales' application connecting with the FTX exchange.

As of now (feb 12, 2022), little account functionality has been added, but plans are to add full trading functionality in a similar fashion to my other project 'tori'.

Command line args:
  * tape-only - display only tape window
  * profile-only - display only volume profile
  * volume-counts - print a tally of volume conducted at each price level on the profile
